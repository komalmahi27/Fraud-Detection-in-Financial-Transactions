# Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions

One essential machine learning tool for spotting and stopping fraudulent activity in financial transactions is fraud transaction detection. 
It entails looking at past transaction data to find oddities or patterns that can point to fraud, like money laundering, account takeovers, or illegal credit card use. Features like transaction amount, location, time, payment method, merchant information, and user profiles are frequently included in the dataset.

Data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data to guarantee consistency, is the first step in the process. Since adding additional features, including transaction frequency, time since last transaction, or device data, can greatly enhance model performance, feature engineering is essential in fraud detection.

To create classification models that classify transactions as either valid or fraudulent, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks are frequently utilized. The target variable in a labeled dataset used to train these algorithms shows whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC Curve are necessary for assessing the model. While recall makes ensuring the model doesn't overlook real fraud incidents, precision makes sure the model correctly detects fraudulent transactions with few false positives. Maintaining client trust while reducing fraud losses requires striking a balance between these criteria.
